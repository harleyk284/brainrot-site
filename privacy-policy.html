    <p>Brainrot Studios ("we," "us," or "our") develops and publishes <strong>Escape the Brainrot</strong> (the "Game"), a mobile application available on Android and iOS. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, store, and share information when you use our Game.</p>

    <p>By downloading, installing, or using the Game, you agree to this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree, please do not use the Game.</p>

    <h2>1. Data Controller</h2>
    <p>The data controller responsible for your personal data is:</p>
    <div class="contact-box">

    <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>

    <h3>2.1 Information You Provide</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Display Name:</strong> When you first play, a random display name is automatically generated for you (e.g., "SwiftRunner472"). You may change this to a custom display name of your choice, subject to profanity filtering and a 14-day cooldown between changes. Your display name is publicly visible to other players on leaderboards and friend lists. Display names are stored on PlayFab (Microsoft) servers. Users in Child Mode (under 13) cannot set custom display names and retain only their auto-generated name.</li>
        <li><strong>Friend Connections:</strong> When you add friends using a Player ID or display name, we store that relationship.</li>
        <li><strong>Age Verification:</strong> During initial setup, we ask for your year of birth to verify you meet the minimum age requirement.</li>
        <li><strong>Bug Report Screenshots:</strong> When submitting a bug report, you may optionally attach an image from your device's photo library. The image is sent to our development team and is not stored on our servers or shared with third parties.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2.2 Information Collected Automatically</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Device Information:</strong> Device model, operating system version, graphics hardware, and system memory. This helps us optimize performance and diagnose crashes.</li>
        <li><strong>Device Identifiers:</strong> Anonymous device-based identifiers used for account creation and authentication. We do not collect your name, email address, phone number, or physical address.</li>
        <li><strong>Gameplay Data:</strong> Scores, distance traveled, coins and gems earned, power-ups used, missions completed, characters unlocked, items equipped, and session timestamps. This data is used to save your progress and populate leaderboards.</li>
        <li><strong>Purchase Information:</strong> Records of in-app purchases (product IDs, timestamps). Payment processing is handled entirely by Apple (App Store) or Google (Google Play); we do not collect or store credit card numbers or billing addresses.</li>

    <h2>4. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Save and sync your game progress</strong> across devices via cloud saves.</li>
        <li><strong>Provide leaderboards and social features</strong> so you can compete and connect with friends.</li>
        <li><strong>Display advertisements</strong> to support the free-to-play model. If you consent to personalized ads, ad content may be tailored to your interests. You can opt out at any time. You may also manage your Google ad preferences at <a href="https://adssettings.google.com" target="_blank">https://adssettings.google.com</a>.</li>
        <li><strong>Process in-app purchases</strong> and deliver purchased content (gems, skins, subscriptions).</li>
        <li><strong>Diagnose crashes and improve stability</strong> using crash reports (only when you have opted in).</li>
        <li><strong>Improve the Game</strong> by analyzing aggregated, anonymized gameplay patterns.</li>
        <li><strong>Prevent fraud and abuse</strong> in purchases and leaderboards.</li>
        <li><strong>Investigate and resolve bugs</strong> using bug reports and optional screenshot attachments you submit.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Your Choices and Consent</h2>
    <p>When you first launch the Game, you are presented with a consent screen where you can choose to enable or disable the following. Each option is presented separately and is not bundled with other terms:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Personalized Ads:</strong> Controls whether ads are tailored to your interests. Disabled by default. You can deny this and still see non-personalized ads.</li>
        <li><strong>Crash Reporting:</strong> Controls whether crash data is sent to Firebase Crashlytics. Disabled by default.</li>
        <li><strong>Cloud Saves:</strong> Controls whether your progress is synced to PlayFab servers. If disabled, progress is saved locally only.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You can update your preferences at any time through the Game's Settings menu. You may also select "Deny All" to refuse all optional data collection. <strong>Withdrawing consent does not affect the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal.</strong></p>

    <h3>5.1 Ad Tracking (iOS)</h3>
    <p>On iOS devices, we request your permission via Apple's App Tracking Transparency (ATT) framework before collecting the Identifier for Advertisers (IDFA) for ad personalization. You can change this permission at any time in your device's Settings &gt; Privacy &amp; Security &gt; Tracking.</p>

    <h3>5.2 Consent Management for EEA/UK/Switzerland</h3>
    <p>For users in the European Economic Area, United Kingdom, and Switzerland, we use a consent mechanism compliant with the IAB Transparency and Consent Framework (TCF) to obtain and manage your consent for personalized advertising.</p>

    <h2>6. Data Sharing</h2>
    <p><strong>We do not sell your personal information.</strong></p>
    <p>We may share device identifiers and ad interaction data with Google AdMob for the purpose of serving advertisements. Under some privacy laws (including the California Consumer Privacy Act), this may constitute "sharing" of personal information for cross-context behavioral advertising. You may opt out of this sharing at any time through the in-game consent screen or by selecting "Deny All" for personalized ads.</p>
    <p>We share data with the third-party services listed in Section 2.3, and only for the purposes described. Specifically:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Google AdMob</strong> receives device and usage data to serve advertisements.</li>
        <li><strong>PlayFab (Microsoft)</strong> receives gameplay data to provide cloud saves, leaderboards, and social features.</li>
        <li><strong>Firebase Crashlytics (Google)</strong> receives device and crash data to help us fix bugs (only when you opt in).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Your display name, Player ID, high score, player level, and approximate last-login time are visible to other players who add you as a friend.</p>

        <li><strong>Local data</strong> (on your device) is deleted when you uninstall the Game.</li>
        <li><strong>Bug report screenshots</strong> are retained only in the developer's email inbox and are deleted after the issue is resolved.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>8. Data Security</h2>
    <p>We use industry-standard security measures to protect your data:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>All data transmitted between the Game and our servers uses encrypted connections (HTTPS/TLS).</li>
        <li>PlayFab cloud data is stored on Microsoft Azure infrastructure with enterprise-grade security.</li>
        <li>We do not store passwords, payment details, or sensitive personal information on our servers.</li>
        <li>We maintain a written information security program appropriate to the size and scope of our data collection.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>No method of electronic transmission or storage is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>

    <h2>9. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>We present a neutral age screen when the Game is first launched. Users who indicate they are under 13 are placed into <strong>"Child Mode"</strong>, which automatically disables all optional data collection and online features. In Child Mode:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Only non-personalized, contextual ads are displayed (no behavioral targeting or data collection for advertising purposes)</li>
        <li>No analytics data is collected</li>
        <li>No crash reports are sent</li>
        <li>No cloud saves or online leaderboards (progress is saved locally only)</li>
        <li>No PlayFab account is created or accessed</li>
        <li>No custom display names &mdash; users retain only the auto-generated random name assigned at first launch</li>
        <li>In-app purchases remain available (subject to platform parental controls)</li>
    </ul>
